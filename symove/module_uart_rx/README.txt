Generic UART Receiver
*********************

scope:
   General Use

description:
   Uart Receiver with the full range of baud rate (up to 115.2KBaud),
   parity, stop bits and bits per character support

keywords:
   UART

boards:
   XK-SKC-L2, XA-SK-GPIO

This module is completely parameterisable at run time and will require
whole logical core. Unlike the alternative simple/fast uart, it can
operate at the standard UART baud rates, and is fully configurable
with respect to bits per character, stop bits and parity.
